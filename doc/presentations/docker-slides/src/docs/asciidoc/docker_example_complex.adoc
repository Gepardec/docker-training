== What do we want to learn?

image:docker_example_complex.svg[title="Complex example",caption="Complex example",align=center]

[.text-left]
* How to use Docker Networks 
* How to use the Docker Registry
* How to connect Docker Containers in a network
* How to Backup/Restore a Docker Container

=== The example

* The application is a simple __todo__ application
* The __todo__ application needs these env vars: 
** __DB_URL__, __DB_USER__, __DB_PASSWORD__
* The host running the Docker Container must have internet access
* The MariaDb Docker Image: link:https://hub.docker.com/_/mariadb/[]
* The database needs to be accessible when the __todo__ application starts

== The Application Docker Image

[source,bash]
-----
FROM library/java:8-alpine
MAINTAINER ...
LABEL ...
RUN ...
COPY ...
CMD ...
-----

[.text-left]
* Create a Dockerfile for the application
* Define a label describing how to use the Docker image
* Copy jar from the context in the directory ``/work``
* Define a proper start command for the application
* Build the Docker Image and tag it with __todo-app:latest__

=== Solution

[source,bash]
----
include::./examples/complex/Dockerfile[]
----
[source,bash]
----
include::./examples/complex/commands.sh[tag=build]
----

== The Docker Volume

[source, bash]
-----
# Create the Docker Volume
docker volume ...
-----

* Create the Docker Volume for the database with name __todo-db-vol__
* This is the volume keeping the database persistent

=== Solution
[source, bash]
-----
include::./examples/complex/commands.sh[tag=volume]
-----

== The Docker Network

[source, bash]
-----
# Create the Docker Network
docker network ...
-----

* Create the Docker Network for database with name __todo-net__
* This is the network for the database and todo application

=== Solution

[source, bash]
-----
include::./examples/complex/commands.sh[tag=network]
-----

== Provision Docker Containers

-----
# 1. Create the Docker Containers
docker container ...

# 2. Start the Docker Containers
docker container ...
-----

* Create the Docker Containers with names __todo-app__ and __todo-db__
* Start the __todo-db__ Docker Container and wait until its up 
* Start the __todo-app__ Docker Container
* Access the application via link:http://localhost:8080[]

=== Solution

[source, bash]
-----
include::./examples/complex/commands.sh[tag=provision]
-----

== Some questions?

* What happens if we don't add the __todo-app__ Docker Container to the Docker Network?
* What happens if we don't publish the port of the __todo-app__?
* What happens if we misconfigure one of the environment variables?

=== Solution

* Then __todo-app__ cannot connect to the database, because __todo-app__ is not in the network
* Then we cannot access the __todo-app__ web view, because the port 8080 is not published
* __todo-app__ cannot start or access the database, because parameters are missing or faulty?

== Backup the database

[source, bash]
-----
# 1. Stop the Docker Containers
docker container ...

# 2. Backup the database
docker run ...

# 3. Start the Docker Containers
docker container ...
-----

* Create entries in the todo app
* Perform a backup

=== Solution

[source, bash]
-----
include::./examples/complex/commands.sh[tag=backup]
-----

== Restore the database

[source, bash]
-----
# 1. Stop the Docker Containers
docker container ...

# 2. Restore the database
docker run ...

# 3. Start the Docker Containers
docker container ...
-----

* Create entries in the todo app
* Perform a restore

=== Solution

[source, bash]
-----
include::./examples/complex/commands.sh[tag=restore]
-----

== Cleanup
[source, bash]
-----
# 1. Delete Delete the Docker Containers
docker container ...

# 2. Delete the Docker Image
docker image ...

# 3. Delete the Docker Network
docker network ...

# 3. Delete the Volume
docker volume ...
-----

=== Solution

[source, bash]
-----
include::./examples/complex/commands.sh[tag=cleanup]
